              "      <td>getting sick of everything so i m a year old boy whose life has been boring and lonely for years of it from the day that i was born until the age of i did not have someone who i would consider a friend people who were my friends at that time only used me for my skills and they were manipulating me in every way you might wonder why didn t i leave these people in the first place the answer is that i had no idea that i was being used the whole time so i decided to make a change and start making real friends and talk to people i started doing this back in march of i joined a gc and talked to people in that gc a girl was doing self harm and was suicidal i decided to help her because i had nothing else to do at that time little did i know that she was doing all of this for attention so we became good friends and i was really happy because it was the first time that i had the chance to talk to a girl and become friends with one the friendship was very one sided and she was cheating and lying every time she even lied to me about her age the whole i was ignoring these major red flags even though i know it was not right i thought that if i stopped talking to that girl no one else will so fast forward into a few months i meet another girl and this time the new girl helped me overcome all the lies and fakeness that i ve been through i easily got over that first girl things went really great for a long time and i was in my all time high and i was happier than ever things were going really great until september of months with my new friend and i made a mistake that ruined everything and she blocked me out everywhere a few days after the incident we came back together but it was never the same as before fast forward to december she stops talking to me completely because she was being uncomfortable with me i went through some huge breakdowns and needed to visit a therapist which revealed that i ve had some major issues including anxiety disorder social anxiety abandonment issues fomo and that i am a very sensitive person for the entire month of december i was completely alone and i tried making new friends because i lost the only one that i had i tried finding new friends but it didn t work it was new year s eve that she started talking to me again and i was happy once again because i now have a friend after all of that hard time i went through fast forward to march and april she severely reduces the amount of conversation that we have and i only talked to her in a gc that we were in very rarely in the dms yesterday she told me that she wants to unfriend me for good and not talk to me again she was sounding sarcastic because we quite often insult each other for fun and i thought that she was just kidding like all the other times but it turns out that it was not the case this time she removed me as a friend on every social media and i left the gc that we were in because i m sure that she was not talking because of my existence in there and now i m left with no friends or social life again she is a very straightforward person which is good and she told that i am a boring person i m not denying that at all she was the most impactful and interesting thing ever to happen in my whole life for my entire life i ve been emotionally and mentally abused by everyone surrounding me including my parents i was always being victimized even when it was not my fault no one ever committed to a real friendship with me except her that s why she is the most important person in my life compared to most people i m inferior and i have nothing to offer but that doesn t mean that i won t put any effort into my friendships for the entire time that we were friends i always had her chat windows open discord and it was always covering up half of my screen even if we were not talking just to be prepared to reply on time i changed my entire sleeping schedule just to not miss a single text from her and i never said no to anything if she ever asked to do anything i was always doing it and i never let her down she is the only person that i fully trust and feel comfortable around even though we live thousands of miles away from each other the average person might consider me very picky of choosing friends and that s true i completely lack self identity and i tend to copy the person that i like or i m talking to that s one big reason why she didn t feel comfortable around me i was listening to the same music she listened to and etc but the truth is that i actually liked them because i never had any taste in basic things such as music shows choices and everything else that s why i need to be careful in choosing friends i will easily get influenced by them and now i m here again starting from zero no friends no social life spending hours a day on tiktok and achieving nothing due to lack of motivation and i don t get a single notification the whole day luckily i have weeks of spring break right now and i don t have any school work i m really getting sick and tired of this i always put the most effort into everything and i always do my best in a friendship and to add more to that i only had friend the whole time just so i can always be there for her i was feeling content but why does all my effort go into nothing i promise you i m doing my best and i m going overboard to be a good friend if you want some context about my personality search these up i m an intj w and i have virgo placements in my big if you are into that i m not saying that these define my life or anything but they have become major barriers in my life i know i lack emotional intelligence and i don t have the best talking skills out there but i m still doing everything that i can i m a simple person i just want a friend i just want to be a part of a group of gc which i m not at all now believe me i ll do my best and ill be fully committed if you are my friend i m always available to talk to you in discord tiktok snapchat instagram and everywhere else if you reached here thank you for reading that and my dms are open if you wanted to talk to say anything and maybe even become friends</td>\n",

strive for i tend to be a realistic person overall or at least i try to when im in a crappy mood i may be pessimistic or when im in a good mood then i may be optimistic but in general i am just realistic or at least i try to that may include some pessimistic thinking but that pessimistic thinking is reality or at least i think it is you can say the same for optimistic thinking its reality or at least i think it is and the reason i want to be realistic is because i think realistically and i end up in the right direction sure optimism will make you feel happy and motivate you but i feel like it will also end up in a bad path thinking ur in a good path but sure as long as youre happy and with pessimism you feel like you need to keep pushing yourself which can be good to improve a lot but with realism you get both in a way you push when reality is youre not there but when you are there you congratulate yourself for it or whatever i wanna think realistically because i wanna be truthful and get the right deserving amount of criticism and congrats and thatll push me in the right direction in life   \n",

best friends was this girl anna she was amazing in every way we used to do all kinds of things and get in all kinds of fucking trouble together she always managed to make someone feel good about themselves even if they didn t deserve it but she had type diabetes as well as other shit that made living a pain for her her parents have never made enough money but they always barely had enough for her insulin but after covid they didn t have enough money at all so anna was trying to ration her insulin but it wasn t for her it was false hope for her parents she knew she was going to die either way she had a quater of a months worth of insulin to ration for months she even told me don t miss me too much ok i was always there for her and it hurts that i wasn t there when she passed she was all alone there wasn t even a funeral because of covid she would have been today she always wanted to be just so she could now she s never going to be able to fuck human greed she needed medicine to stay alive that her parents couldn t afford because some asshats exploit the needs of others for their own gain   \n",

              "30232  getting sick of everything so i m a year old boy whose life has been boring and lonely for years of it from the day that i was born until the age of i did not have someone who i would consider a friend people who were my friends at that time only used me for my skills and they were manipulating me in every way you might wonder why didn t i leave these people in the first place the answer is that i had no idea that i was being used the whole time so i decided to make a change and start making real friends and talk to people i started doing this back in march of i joined a gc and talked to people in that gc a girl was doing self harm and was suicidal i decided to help her because i had nothing else to do at that time little did i know that she was doing all of this for attention so we became good friends and i was really happy because it was the first time that i had the chance to talk to a girl and become friends with one the friendship was very one sided and she was cheating and lying every time she even lied to me about her age the whole i was ignoring these major red flags even though i know it was not right i thought that if i stopped talking to that girl no one else will so fast forward into a few months i meet another girl and this time the new girl helped me overcome all the lies and fakeness that i ve been through i easily got over that first girl things went really great for a long time and i was in my all time high and i was happier than ever things were going really great until september of months with my new friend and i made a mistake that ruined everything and she blocked me out everywhere a few days after the incident we came back together but it was never the same as before fast forward to december she stops talking to me completely because she was being uncomfortable with me i went through some huge breakdowns and needed to visit a therapist which revealed that i ve had some major issues including anxiety disorder social anxiety abandonment issues fomo and that i am a very sensitive person for the entire month of december i was completely alone and i tried making new friends because i lost the only one that i had i tried finding new friends but it didn t work it was new year s eve that she started talking to me again and i was happy once again because i now have a friend after all of that hard time i went through fast forward to march and april she severely reduces the amount of conversation that we have and i only talked to her in a gc that we were in very rarely in the dms yesterday she told me that she wants to unfriend me for good and not talk to me again she was sounding sarcastic because we quite often insult each other for fun and i thought that she was just kidding like all the other times but it turns out that it was not the case this time she removed me as a friend on every social media and i left the gc that we were in because i m sure that she was not talking because of my existence in there and now i m left with no friends or social life again she is a very straightforward person which is good and she told that i am a boring person i m not denying that at all she was the most impactful and interesting thing ever to happen in my whole life for my entire life i ve been emotionally and mentally abused by everyone surrounding me including my parents i was always being victimized even when it was not my fault no one ever committed to a real friendship with me except her that s why she is the most important person in my life compared to most people i m inferior and i have nothing to offer but that doesn t mean that i won t put any effort into my friendships for the entire time that we were friends i always had her chat windows open discord and it was always covering up half of my screen even if we were not talking just to be prepared to reply on time i changed my entire sleeping schedule just to not miss a single text from her and i never said no to anything if she ever asked to do anything i was always doing it and i never let her down she is the only person that i fully trust and feel comfortable around even though we live thousands of miles away from each other the average person might consider me very picky of choosing friends and that s true i completely lack self identity and i tend to copy the person that i like or i m talking to that s one big reason why she didn t feel comfortable around me i was listening to the same music she listened to and etc but the truth is that i actually liked them because i never had any taste in basic things such as music shows choices and everything else that s why i need to be careful in choosing friends i will easily get influenced by them and now i m here again starting from zero no friends no social life spending hours a day on tiktok and achieving nothing due to lack of motivation and i don t get a single notification the whole day luckily i have weeks of spring break right now and i don t have any school work i m really getting sick and tired of this i always put the most effort into everything and i always do my best in a friendship and to add more to that i only had friend the whole time just so i can always be there for her i was feeling content but why does all my effort go into nothing i promise you i m doing my best and i m going overboard to be a good friend if you want some context about my personality search these up i m an intj w and i have virgo placements in my big if you are into that i m not saying that these define my life or anything but they have become major barriers in my life i know i lack emotional intelligence and i don t have the best talking skills out there but i m still doing everything that i can i m a simple person i just want a friend i just want to be a part of a group of gc which i m not at all now believe me i ll do my best and ill be fully committed if you are my friend i m always available to talk to you in discord tiktok snapchat instagram and everywhere else if you reached here thank you for reading that and my dms are open if you wanted to talk to say anything and maybe even become friends   \n",

stressful shit going on and no one to talk to and im so busy i cant get a break until after christmas ugh   \n",
